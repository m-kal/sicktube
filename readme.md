# Roadmap

* [ ] Start with a scanner for existing folders and convert my manual process to a daemon running in python
* [ ] Scan those folders using youtube-dl and taking the metadata (not downloading the files) and feed it into plex
* [ ] Create a channel to browse the configuration URLs for the existing folders
* [ ] Convert the browsing to existing folders to browsing youtube/other-sites and on access, check for local cache else play and cache in background
* [ ] Publish for github
